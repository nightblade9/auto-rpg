Play here: Heroku link TBD

# Vision

A single-player game in a massive, generated-on-demand world! You manage a shifting party of members as you accept and complete quests, manage equipment, character progression, battle preferences, and more!

Also includes a standalone console you can use to view progress (and maybe in the future, preferences).

# Major Features

- Choose which quests to accept and build rapport with different groups
- Build your characters by selecting their equipment, and skills/stats as they level up
- Recruit multiple party members of varying backgrounds and goals
- Engage in epic battles against hordes of monsters
- Fight massively powerful boss-beasts in battle after battle as you whittle them down
- Monitor status regularly with an oldschool ASCII console app

# Development Notes

To run all the ReactJS tests, run `npm test` from `AutoRPG.Web/ClientApp`.
